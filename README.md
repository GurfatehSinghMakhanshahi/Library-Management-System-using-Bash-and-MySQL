# Library-Management-System-using-Bash-and-MySQL

Developed a Library Management System using Bash scripting and MySQL. The project allows users to add, remove, and view books and members through a terminal-based menu. SQL queries are executed within Bash functions, and MySQL Workbench is used to monitor and verify data stored in the database.
